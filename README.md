1. `git clone` that script
2. Supply a git repo that will be used as a cloud for your dotfiles.

Term _file_ stands for file a general (not only regular files). Say we have file f.txt: "~/soft/f.txt"

* `f.txt` stands for _name_ or _base name_,
* `~/soft/` stands for _dir_name_,
* `~/soft/f.txt` stands for _path_.
